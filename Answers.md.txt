Question 1:
The stream abstraction is a sequence of data elements made available over time. It's like an asynchronous array, but instead of having all its elements available immediately, they arrive over time. This makes streams particularly useful for handling asynchronous data, like user interactions, HTTP requests, and real-time data.

The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes. In the context of streams, the stream is the subject and the observers are the functions or operations that react to the data in the stream.

The relationship between streams and the observer pattern is that streams use the observer pattern to allow functions to subscribe to them and react to the data they emit. When a stream emits a new data element, all its observers are notified and react to the new data.

Streams are useful for modeling a variety of things in Rich Web development, including:

User interactions, like clicks, mouse movements, and keyboard input.
Server-sent events, like real-time updates from a server.
Interval-based operations, like animations or periodic updates.
Asynchronous operations, like HTTP requests.

You might use streams in Rich Web development whenever you need to handle asynchronous data or events, especially when you need to perform complex transformations or operations on that data. For example, you might use streams to handle user input, animate elements, fetch data from a server, or any other operation that involves asynchronous data.


Question 2:
To use the RxJS library to handle asynchronous network responses to API requests, you can use the ajax method provided by RxJS.

The ajax method returns an observable that emits the response from the API when it arrives. The subscribe method is used to handle the response when it arrives and any errors that occur during the request.

The benefits of using a streams library like RxJS for networking over promises include:

Flexibility: Observables can be cancelled, retried, and manipulated in ways that promises cannot. This makes them more flexible for complex use cases.
Powerful operators: RxJS provides a wide range of operators that can be used to transform, filter, combine, and manipulate observables. This can greatly simplify complex asynchronous code.
Unified API: RxJS provides a unified API for handling all kinds of asynchronous data, not just network requests. This can make your code more consistent and easier to understand.
The downsides of using RxJS for networking include:

Complexity: RxJS has a steeper learning curve than promises. It can be overkill for simple use cases that can be easily handled with promises.
Size: RxJS is a large library, which can increase the size of your bundle and the load time of your app.
Debugging: Debugging RxJS code can be more difficult than debugging promise-based code, especially for developers who are not familiar with the library.


Question 3:
Sharing global state among asynchronous tasks can lead to several issues:

Race Conditions: If tasks A, B, and C are all trying to read and write from the same global state, they might overwrite each other's changes. The final state could depend on the order in which the tasks finish, which is often unpredictable in asynchronous programming.

Difficulty in Debugging and Maintenance: Shared global state can make the system harder to understand and debug. If a bug occurs due to the state being incorrect, it can be hard to trace which task caused the issue.

Tight Coupling: Sharing global state can lead to tight coupling between tasks, making the code less modular and harder to reuse.

To alleviate these problems, you can follow these good practices:

Avoid Global State: Where possible, avoid global state. Instead, use local state within functions or tasks.

Immutability: Make your state immutable. Instead of modifying the state directly, create a new copy of the state with the necessary changes. This can help prevent race conditions.

Use Synchronization Primitives: If you must use shared state, use synchronization primitives like locks or semaphores to ensure that only one task can modify the state at a time.

Use Higher-Level Abstractions: Libraries like RxJS provide higher-level abstractions for managing shared state in an asynchronous environment. These can help manage complexity and prevent bugs.

Functional Programming: Adopt functional programming principles. In functional programming, functions avoid changing state and mutable data. This can help to avoid side effects and make the code easier to understand and predict.
